Here’s a detailed **project architecture** for a **Coursera Clone**, designed to support features such as course browsing, user registration, enrollment, content delivery, and more. This architecture builds upon the idea of replicating the functionality of the Coursera platform, ensuring scalability, usability, and maintainability.

---

## **Project Architecture Overview**

The Coursera Clone is structured into four layers:

1. **Frontend**: The user interface for learners, instructors, and administrators.
2. **Backend**: The server-side application for handling business logic and data processing.
3. **Database**: Persistent storage for user information, course content, and activity logs.
4. **Infrastructure**: Deployment, monitoring, and scaling tools.

Each layer interacts through APIs, ensuring modularity and flexibility for future enhancements.
